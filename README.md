# Explainable Text Classification
Simple but effective explainable test classication by taking the gradients of an embedding text input with respect to the output.
<br />
<br />
The higher the gradient of a single word, the more influence it had on the output; if the output probability is > 0.5, the rating is considered positive, and below that, negative.
